### Next steps:
* Define a return type standard (a Go struct that is then returned as json ? status code etc.)
* clean run.csx
* clean code
* unit tests
* Documentation
* Publish
* expose commands (delete etc.)
* add commands (monitoring etc)
* allow multiple functions to be deployed at once
* Any way to reduce upload time of main.exe?
