### Next steps:
* Force nuget restore
* Return url of the created function
* clean run.csx
* clean code
* unit tests
* Documentation
* Publish
* expose commands (delete etc.)
* add commands (monitoring etc)
* allow multiple functions to be deployed at once
* Any way to reduce upload time of main.exe?
